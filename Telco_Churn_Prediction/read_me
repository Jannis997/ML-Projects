Telco Customer Churn Dataset

This project processes the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from IBM. 
This dataset is about a fictional telecommunication provider which faces churn of his customers.
Each row of this dataset represents one customer and each columns contains customer's attributes.
One of the attribute is Churn (the label) and is eaither 0 (No Churn) or 1 (Churn).
The other columns contain information about the Services that each customer has signed up to, demographic information about the customer
and customer account information (Charges, payment method...).

In this project i focused on a solution using classic maschine learning techniques such as logistic regression,
RandomForest, KNeighbors...)
I also used ensemble methods to combine the best performing models.
