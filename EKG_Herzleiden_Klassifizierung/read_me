Arrhythmia Dataset

This project processes the Arrhythmia Dataset from Physionet's MIT-BIH. 
This dataset contains 109446 samples that correspond to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals of heartbeats.
Each sample represents one heartbeat.
The first 187 columns of each sample represent the ECG signal of the heartbeat, measured in a frequency of 125 Hz.
The last column represents the class that the heartbeat is part of.
There are 5 classes: Normal, Supraventricular, Ventricular, Fusion, Unknown.

In this project i focused on a solution using a Deep Neural Network.
For this i am neglecting other possible solutions like other classsification models and also 
Convolutional Neural Networks.
